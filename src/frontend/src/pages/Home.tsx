          It is a living stack — a structure that thinks, evolves, and expresses itself through
          architecture.
          At its core is the Architectonic Engine, the self‑evolving layer where Activated Agents
          operate as a coordinated micro‑civilization.

        <p>
          Every packet, every build, every surface is part of a single organism learning how to
          become itself.
